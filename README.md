# Python Raycasting: 

After developing a Python Raycasting video game (check previous commits) based on Pygame & Numpy, i've discovered that the game lacked a lot of features and ran badly because of bugs and glitches.

I chose to cease the development for a few months but now i'm going to re-make the game (based on the previous code).

I will focus on hunting bugs and unnecessary glitches. The game will be well optimized and will run smoothly.
