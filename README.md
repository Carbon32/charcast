# Python Raycasting: 

A ray casting game made with Python, based on Pygame & Numpy. The game code has been optimized using Numba library.
The game code is split into small scripts including functions, frame, movement, variables and window.

The code is for preview purposes, i don't recommand building on-top of it, it's so unstable and full of bugs and glitches.

I don't think i will be developing this anymore.

Currently the game is unstable and suffers from performance issues.
